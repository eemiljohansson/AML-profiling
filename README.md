# AML-profiling
This code was generated in the context of the study “Blood proteome profiling using proximity extension assay in patients with acute myeloid leukemia”, were a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome was performed on AML patients using a pan-cancer cohort representing the major cancer types and a healthy cohort as controls.

# The study

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemias in adults. Given the complexity of the disease, proteomic profiling presents an opportunity to discover early diagnostic biomarkers that could facilitate a shorter and simpler workflow for arriving at the diagnosis. This study was conducted by analyzing 1 463 plasma proteins in 52 AML patients at diagnosis using the Olink Explore 1536 platform. Both differential expression analysis and feature selection by machine learning were applied to find the most significant proteins to distinguish AML from 867 healthy individuals and 1 734 patients of varying cancer types, including different hematological malignancies. The analysis identified proteins with significant altered expression in AML patients, highlighting potential biomarkers.
